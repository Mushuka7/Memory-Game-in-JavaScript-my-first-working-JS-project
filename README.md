# Memory-Game-in-JavaScript-my-first-working-JS-project
This program is a fun memory game where you flip cards to find matching pairs. Each card starts with a default image, and when you click on them, they reveal their true identity. If you pick two matching cards, they stay flipped; if not, they reset after a moment. Try it, maybe you'll find all of the cards that match!
